# Pirate-Man

As the final project for my (independent study)[../independent-study], I had to
write a program to meet the needs of a customer. A faculty member in charge of
the school newspaper asked me to implement a version of Pac-Man inspired by our
mascot, a pirate.

The game logic relies heavily on a few state machines and a decision tree for
each ghost. It uses the [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) 2D game programming
library to handle input, output, and audio.
