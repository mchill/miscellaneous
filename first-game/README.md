# First Game

At the end of my high school calculus class, we were challenged to learn
something new. I chose to follow a great
[tutorial](http://fixbyproximity.com/2d-game-development-course/) on how to
create a game using the Allegro 2D game programming library.

The game uses structs instead of C++ classes, so it is not actually object
oriented in the formal sense. I later followed another tutorial created by the
same person that redesigned the game to be object oriented.
