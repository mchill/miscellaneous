# Skydiving Website

I had to program a simple website using HTML and CSS for a project at the end
of my high school Multimedia and Web Design class. I took it a bit further than
required, and ended up with my first large programming project.

The website has a multi-level user account system, appointment registration,
and a functional forum. All of this required designing a database schema, too.
Granted, it is all incredibly insecure and prone to bugs, but this was my first
adventure in programming.

Fun fact: the only part of the website that uses JavaScript is the banner menu.
