  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
  <p>In our skydiving registration form, we ask for your name, email, and phone number. We will also ask for the date and time that you would like to skydive. When user registration is submitted, there is no automated way to remove that data. You must contact us over the phone or at our office to cancel or change registration. When users sign up for our website, we collect their username, password, and email address. This data will be erased upon account deletion.</p>
  <h3>What is the information used for?</h3>
  <p>We use the information that you submit in registration to keep a record of who is signed up for skydiving when. However, registering to skydive on our site is not enough, as you must call us to confirm and pay for your appointment. We use the information when creating an account only for confirmation purposes. User data and entries will never be distributed to any third party.</p>
  <h3>Who has access to your information?</h3>
  <p>We, at Skyline Skydiving, are the only ones with legal access to your information. That being said, there is a small chance that a hostile user could obtain your information. You take that risk when you submit information to us, and we are not responsible for any stolen information.</p>
  <h3>Your Consent</h3>
  <p>As the user, you consent to this privacy policy by either registering to skydive or by creating an account. You will be requested to agree to the privacy policy and <a href="terms of service.php">terms of service</a> when you take part in either action.</p>
  <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>Our privacy policy is subject to change without notice ahead of time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Be sure to check this page frequently, to be sure that you are aware of the latest rules and terms of use for the website.</p>
  <h3>Special Note</h3>
  <p>In case you have not figured this out yet, this is a student-made website for a school project. The contact information given in this website is fake, and you will not actually be signed up to skydive if you fill out our form. Security measures have been taken to protect user information, but this website is not as secure as a professional website.</p>
