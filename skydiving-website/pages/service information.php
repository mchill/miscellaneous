  <h2>Skydiving</h2>
  <h3>What</h3>
  <p>The first step is for us to teach you a few safety rules. You must pay attention during this time, or else you may die when you jump from the helicopter. We will then take you into the sky and show you around for a while. You will be able to see the beautiful New York skyline during your ride. After an hour, we will push you out of the helicopter and hope that you were listening to the safety instructions. If you arrive in good condition to ground level, we will then pick you back up and fly you back to the starting point.</p>
  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>Anyone in good physical condition, at least at the age of 18, can skydive. Of course, you must also not be afraid of heights.</p>
  <h3>Time</h3>
  <p>We offer skydiving Monday through Saturday all year long. We even force our employees to work on major holidays for your enjoyment! Appointments can be made at 8am, 10am, 1pm, 3pm, and 5pm everyday. You will be up in the sky for around an hour before you jump. It will take around half an hour to pick you back up and take you back to the starting point.</p>
  <h3>Place</h3>
  <p>You must arrive at our office a few minutes before your appointment time. Our office is at 74 Random St, Hoboken, New Jersey. We will fly you around the outskirts of the town and over the water, between New Jersey and New York. The New York skyline will be in clear view for you to admire.</p>
  <h3>Price</h3>
  <p>We put this part last because we wanted to capture your attention before you left this website. The price for one skydiving appointment is $200.00 USD per rider.</p>
  <br /><br /><br />
  <h2>Helicopter Rides</h2>
  <h3>What</h3>
  <p>This service is for our customers who are less interested in risking their lives and enduring thrilling adventure, and more for customers who like to see beautiful scenery from very high up in the sky. Helicopter riders will stay in the helicopter while the skydivers fall very quickly to the hard ground below.</p>
  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>Anyone can participate in this. There is no age limit, but if your baby starts crying, we may lose control of the helicopter and plummet to our doom. So please, be smart when it comes to the age of your children that you bring along.</p>
  <h3>Time</h3>
  <p>Our same hours apply to helicopter rides as they do for skydiving and helicopter rides.</p>
  <h3>Place</h3>
  <p>You will arrive at the same office that skydivers come to, and you will get on the same helicopter. The only difference is that because you never jump out of the helicopter, we do not have to pick you back up at the landing zone.</p>
  <h3>Price</h3>
  <p>Due to the lack of lawsuits that may arise from death upon skydiving for those customers that choose not to skydive, the price is significantly lower. A helicopter ride only costs $100.00 USD per person. Children 5 and under can ride for free.</p>
