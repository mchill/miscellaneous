  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>The employees at Skyline Skydiving are very diverse. It has always been this way, actually. Our company's founders, 2 young men born in New York City, were complete opposites. One man was an ex-navy officer, who's lifelong passion was to fly a helicopter every day. The other man was a city businessman, who worked as a lawyer full time, but in his spare time, enjoyed to walk around the city and admire the beauty of it. They met quite randomly, at a local taco stand in the summer of 1966, and despite their differences, they became friends very fast. They shared their dreams with each other, and they realized that both of them had something to offer to the other. The idea was born to make a skydiving company, where customers could enjoy flying in a helicopter, and could also admire the scenery of New York City from a wonderful view. And so, in 1970, the two men created Skyline Skydiving, which has entertained customers for nearly 30 years.</p>
  <h2>Why did we decide to specialize in skydiving?</h2>
  <p>All of us who work at Skyline Skydiving have similar passions to our company's founders. Whether we're flight fanatics, or we just enjoy looking at the landscape, we love our job here. And we believe that all of you will love our helicopter rides and skydiving as well.</p>
  <h2>What will we do for you?</h2>
  <p>Our business definitely has more to offer then similar businesses out there. We have something to offer to everyone of all ages, provided the person does not have a fear of heights. And we even invite those of you with a fear of heights to come along, perhaps you will get rid of that feeling when you see how great being up in the air admiring the view is. Our main goal is to make every customer satisfied, and to leave everyone wanting to come back again.</p>
