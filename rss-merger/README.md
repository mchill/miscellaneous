# RSS Merger

I created this tool to address several problems that I encountered with certain podcasts that use Patreon to serve premium content.

* Free content is served on a public feed, and premium content on a separate private feed.
* Previously free content that was moved to Patreon has incorrect publish dates.
* Video content is omitted entirely from the RSS feed that Patreon generates.

This tool takes a public feed, a private Patreon feed, and a list of all campaign posts, and generates a single RSS feed with all content and corrected metadata. That .rss file can be easily served by a static website.

I wrote an additional tool that downloads all content and configures the generated output feed so that the content can also be self-hosted.

## Usage

To generate a single RSS feed:

```bash
python build.py --config config.yaml
```

To download all media and update metadata to self-host the media:

```bash
python download.py --url https://my.server.com/path/ --folder /path/to/folder
```

## Configuration

Rather than use command-line arguments, most of tool's configuration is defined by a single yaml file. The file format is documented below.

Patreon secures parts of its API behind the anti-bot service DataDome. To handle this, do the following:
1. Navigate to https://www.patreon.com/api/posts/1 in a browser
2. Complete the anti-captcha test
3. Open network tools
4. Copy datadome cookie value to config file

> Note: This is only for documentation. I included a full example [here](example-config.yaml).
