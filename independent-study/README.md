# Independent Study

My high school did not have a computer science class, so I took an independent
study in C++ programming during my last semester.

I was assigned 18 miniature assignments meant to teach different principles of
programming, ranging from primitive types to simple object oriented programming.
The course culminated in a final project where I used what I learned to design
and develop a program for a customer. See [Pirate-Man](../pirate-man) for more
information.
